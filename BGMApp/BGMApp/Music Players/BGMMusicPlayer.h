//
//  Copyright Â© 2016 Kyle Neideck
//
//  The base class and protocol for music player apps. Also holds the state of the currently
//  selected music player.
//
//  To add support for a music player, create a subclass of BGMMusicPlayerBase that implements
//  BGMMusicPlayerProtocol. BGMSpotify will probably be the most useful example.
//
//  Include the BGM_MUSIC_PLAYER_DEFAULT_LOAD_METHOD macro somewhere in the @implementation block.
//  You might also want to override the icon method if the default implementation from
//  BGMMusicPlayerBase doesn't work.
//
//  The music player classes written so far use Scripting Bridge to communicate with the music
//  player apps (see iTunes.h/Spotify.h) but any other way is fine too.
//
//  If you're not sure what bundle ID the music player uses, install a debug build of BGMDriver
//  and play something in the music player. The easiest way is to do
//      build_and_install.sh -d
//  BGMDriver will log the bundle ID to system.log when it becomes aware of the music player.
//
